These cases are handled properly by the barangay officials as their support to human rights. The husbands and wives
that are reported are submitted to DSWD, the culprit/suspect of the rape case have been thrown out to jail but the 
suspect was released because of bribery and lack of evidence by the witness. Moreover, the tourists are obliged to 
pay a fine of 150 pesos and is advised to collect their own plate number that is confiscated.
