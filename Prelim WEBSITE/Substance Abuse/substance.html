<h2> OVERVIEW: </h2>

<nav class= "content">

<pre>
Drug rehabilitation is the process of medical treatment for dependency on psychoactive substances such as alcohol, prescription drugs, and street drugs such as cocaine,
heroin or amphetamines. The Barangay, Mirador's issue on substance abuse and rehabilitation involves people who uses drugs, people who surrender, people who got gun 
shot and people who sent to jail. All of these were due to drug usage. The platform that barangay issued is to make a house to house visit with the help of responsible
police officers bringing a K9 dog which is trained to locate drugs. Also, the barangay mandated the people to report drug users in order to help the person by sending 
them to the rehabilitation facility center. There are many different types of drug rehab facilities. Some specialize in helping patients with a specific drug addiction;
others offer a broader range of drug addiction services or programs. Some rehab facilities are even gender or age-specific, as this often helps patients feel more 
comfortable in the rehab setting. Patients have to undergo detox treatment before entering a rehab facility. To sum up, the Barangay is making their place better and
peaceful community.

<h2> Case: </h2>

<pre>
When Mr. Rodrigo Duterte was elected as the President of the Philippines, he had exterminated most of the cases in drugs.
So this means, across the cities and provinces of the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte had to make his move on cases.
The case brought up, tears of sorrowfulness to families who had lost their precious loved ones because of the war on drugs.
In addition, people start getting blamed because of drugs and people are getting killed. A case in several parts of Baguio,
including in Lourdes Dominican Mirador, that has been reported by the Barangay. Nevertheless, the case reported thirteen 
people or more who have been caught using marijuana and other drugs. The people were caught and asked to report other users
but the people who are about to report the main distributor/supplier of drugs just got killed before he got the chance to
tell the police. One was killed, one went to jail, and thirteen were caught using drugs. However, the police are still on
the move to search for other drug users in the barangay of Mirador and other places in Baguio City.
