The barangay Mirador's act towards Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation is that they have platforms for people who's life are controlled by substances which
is not good for their people. They also ensure that the people in their barangay dont use such substances by doing their best to secure the places in the barangay
that there would be no drug dens or such place that can be use to consume substances. The barangay also help a person "if ever" that person is being
controlled by drug or a person can't stop taking substances like drugs by taking them to rehabilitation facility. There are many different types of drug rehab facilities.
Some specialize in helping patients with a specific drug addiction; others offer a broader range of drug addiction services. Some rehab facilities are even
gender- or age-specific, as this often helps patients feel more comfortable in the rehab setting. Inpatient and outpatient rehab facilities are also available. Patients have
to undergo detox treatment before entering a rehab facility. Some rehab facilities are even gender - or - age-specific, as this often helps patients feel more comfortable in
the rehab setting.

To sum up, They Barangay is making their place better and peaceful barangay and also to make childrens focus on studies rather than always hearing substance which
children should not be knowing and things like extra judicial killing, that for a young person which should be ignorant to those kind of things also for the 
rehabilitation they help any person in their barangay that is a drug addict already and they can't help themselve that is where the barangay comes in for a person 
who want their life back in the line.
